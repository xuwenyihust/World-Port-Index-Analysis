- Question 4
  - a
    - Re-constructing the existing code base, in accommodate with the new requirements or resolve historical issues.
    - It should be down whenever 
      - You found the existing code structure very hard to extend / test
      - It's affecting the efficiency of you and other colleagues 
      - You feel confident touching that code base if not originally written by you
      - No other top priority business development working pending
  - b
    - Check if the code runs as you expected
    - When
      - You expect to revisit this piece of code in the future
      - Part of a serious project
      - You'd like to be more confident about what you just wrote down
    - Why
      - Checks whether the code works as expected under some cases 
      - If written ahead of actual code written, could help yourself better organize what to do
      - Explains more explicitly about your think flow
- Question 5
  - Structure
    - .github
      - *github related CI/CD stuffs*
    - docs
      - *Very detailed & interactive documents*
    - fastapi
      - *Source code organized by components*
    - scripts
      - *Shell / Python scripts for tests / env / docs / CI/CD*
    - tests
      - *Test code*
  - Possible improvements
    - fastapi folder could be better organized, for example the exception handling & logging utils are mixed with requests/responses.
